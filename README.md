# 66days
My 66 days of data science

## Reason
From a combination of wanting to change career and the accountability I have to my self to continually push to this repo, I have chosen the option to follow Ken Jee's #66daysofdata (https://www.kennethjee.com/66daysofdata) which builkds upn the principles of habit formation talked about by James Clear in Atomic Habits (https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)


## Day 1 (14/03/2022)
Today I took some time to look through th pkl files in the AlphaFold outputs to determine what was contained within them and how these could be plotted to enable a more efficient interpretation of the resulting protein structures.

## Day 2 (15/03/2022)
I moved back to my CodeCademy course where I was introduced to SciPy at the start of the Supervised Machine Learning module. It showed the manual methods of calculating different distances (Euclidean, Manhattan and Hamming) and how these were compared to using the module.

## Day 3 (16/03/2022)
Continuing on my CodeCademy with linear regression. It introduced the concepts of gradient descent and manually writing methods to calculate this, before showing the concepts repeated more easily in Scikit-Learn.

## Day 4 ( 17/03/2022)
Through code academy I enhanced my knowledge of linear regression with multiple linear regression where one can fit a line to multiple attributes and use it for prediction.

I also began the 'Yelp' data science portfolio project. So far I have improted and worked with the data before merging it. Next time I will clean the data, perform eDA and train models.
